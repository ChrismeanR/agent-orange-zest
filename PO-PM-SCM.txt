Questions that I would be asking during planning or grooming:


Mobile ready or geared to?
How do we plan to roll out versioning for the APIs (if mobile)
Should we use ServiceStack to expose more contracts (XML, SOAP, jSON, etc.)? Swagger? 
What is the user load? 
How are we planning to authenticate (SSO, MFA, other)
Publicly facing APIs, private, how are we ensuring PII and SOX compliance (state/county regulations)
Do we currently have endpoints or data sets we can reuse? Is there any overlap with what we are about to build vs.
 what is already out in production?

How often are we doing db backups? Is this cloud based? 

What is our MVP per sprint? 
How are we defining Definition of Done?
